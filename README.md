##  About NIST SP 800-63B Password Guidelines

- Minimum password length of **8 characters**.
- No requirement for symbols, uppercase, or numbers.
- Allow spaces, emojis, and unicode characters.
- Encourage long and memorable passwords over complex short ones.
- Passwords should be checked against breach lists (optional).

*This toolkit respects the above principles while evaluating password strength.*
